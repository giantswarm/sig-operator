# Operator Healthchecks

During development of
[`app-operator`](https://github.com/giantswarm/app-operator/pull/3), we agreed
that we should not setup `health` service but only endpoint needed since we
don't want to use Kubernetes health check inside operator to prevent cascading
failures. See also
